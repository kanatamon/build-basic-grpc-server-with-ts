# Build a Basic gRPC Server with Typescript

Basic gRPC implementation including unary, server-streaming, and bi-directional.
The types are generated by [gRPC Protobuf Loader](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/tree/master/packages/proto-loader#generating-typescript-types).

## Get started

```sh
yarn dev
```

## Types generation

the [\*.proto](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3) files
are kind of the contacts that defining what the server is going to serve. And
with Typescript, we need types to reflect how \*.proto files are gonna look like.

If \*.proto files have to be changed. You need to manually build the types with
the following command.

```sh
sh build-protos.sh
```

At the moment, there is no tool like [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma)
that has ORM's feature for types generation with quite nice developer experience.
Because, the files generated would be hidden and the less code we have to maintain.

> To be honest, I did NOT know the Prisma types generation work ðŸ˜… under the hood.
> There might be some significant consideration along with how the tool work, and
> that might affect to other scenario.
